# Analysis-and-Pattern-Recognition

The first mentioned will be the "Analysis and Pattern Recognition" repository, in which it is possible to find studies on probabilistic automata and essential methods for the analysis of time series such as PCA, FFT, DFA, entropy and evennes. Furthermore, more robust methods such as KMeans, K-nearest-neighbors(KNN), SOM's and hierarchical agglomerative methods were applied to these data.
